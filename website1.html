     <p id="get">TYping speed is very imoprtant web developing in this modern world and Passport Photos You must provide one photo with your passport application. 
         All our photo policies apply to both adults and children under age 16. We have a few exceptions to our photo policies for infants.
          Photo Basics Submit a color photo, taken in last 6 months Use a clear image of your face. Do not use filters commonly used on social
           media. Have someone else take your photo. No selfies. Take off your eyeglasses for your photo. Use a plain white or off-white background
            Resolution, Print Size, and Quality Submit a high resolution photo that is not blurry, grainy, or pixelated. The correct size of a
             passport photo is: 2 x 2 inches (51 x 51 mm) Head must be between 1 -1 3/8 inches (25 - 35 mm) from the bottom of the chin to the top of
              the head Printed on matte or glossy photo quality paper Do not digitally change the photo You cannot submit a damaged photo with holes,
               creases, or smudges. Pose and Expression Have a neutral facial expression or a natural smile, with both eyes open. Face the camera
                directly with full face in view. Note to parents of young children: we have sample photos in the Photo Examples section below with
                 tips for submitting a baby's passport photo. We realize that an infant's pose and expression are challenging to maintain for a photo.
                  Attire You cannot wear glasses. If you cannot remove your glasses for medical reasons, please include a signed note from your doctor
                   with application. Taken in clothing normally worn on a daily basis. You cannot wear a uniform, clothing that looks like a uniform,
                    or camouflage attire. You cannot wear a hat or head covering. If you wear a hat or head covering for religious purposes, submit a 
                    signed statement that verifies that the hat or head covering in your photo is part of traditional religious attire worn
                     continuously in public. If you wear a hat or head covering for medical purposes, submit a signed doctor's statement verifying 
                     the hat or head covering in your photo is used daily for medical purposes. Your full face must be visible and your hat or head 
                     covering cannot obscure your hairline or cast shadows on your face. You cannot wear headphones or wireless hands-free devices. 
                     You can wear jewelry and keep on your facial piercings as long as they do not hide your face. Permanent tattoos are acceptable 
                     for passport purposes as well.
         I'm sure about this success and when I write in seeing the paper this 
         makes me very difficult
