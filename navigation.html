    You must provide one photo with your passport application.
    
    All our photo policies apply to both adults and children under age 16. We have a few exceptions to our photo policies for infants.
    
    Photo Basics
    Submit a color photo, taken in last 6 months
    Use a clear image of your face. Do not use filters commonly used on social media.
    Have someone else take your photo. No selfies.
    Take off your eyeglasses for your photo.
    Use a plain white or off-white background
    Resolution, Print Size, and Quality
    
    Submit a high resolution photo that is not blurry, grainy, or pixelated.
    The correct size of a passport photo is:
    2 x 2 inches (51 x 51 mm) 
    Head must be between 1 -1 3/8 inches (25 - 35 mm) from the bottom of the chin to the top of the head
    Printed on matte or glossy photo quality paper
    Do not digitally change the photo
    You cannot submit a damaged photo with holes, creases, or smudges.
    Pose and Expression
    
    Have a neutral facial expression or a natural smile, with both eyes open. 
    Face the camera directly with full face in view. 
    Note to parents of young children: we have sample photos in the Photo Examples section below with tips for submitting a baby's passport photo. We realize that an infant's pose and expression are challenging to maintain for a photo. 
    Attire
    
    You cannot wear glasses.
    If you cannot remove your glasses for medical reasons, please include a signed note from your doctor with application.
    Taken in clothing normally worn on a daily basis.  
    You cannot wear a uniform, clothing that looks like a uniform, or camouflage attire. 
    You cannot wear a hat or head covering.
    If you wear a hat or head covering for religious purposes, submit a signed statement that verifies that the hat or head covering in your photo is part of traditional religious attire  worn continuously in public.
    If you wear a hat or head covering for medical purposes, submit a signed doctor's statement verifying the hat or head covering in your photo is used daily for medical purposes.
    Your full face must be visible and your hat or head covering cannot obscure your hairline or cast shadows on your face.
    You cannot wear headphones or wireless hands-free devices.
    You can wear jewelry and keep on your facial piercings as long as they do not hide your face. Permanent tattoos are acceptable for passport purposes as well.</p>

    <h1></h1>World Wide Fund for Nature</h1>
    <p>
        <img src="panda.png" width="400" height="500" align="left"/>
        The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international non-governmental organization founded in 1961, working in the field of wilderness preservation, and the reduction of human impact on the environment.[5] It was formerly named the World Wildlife Fund, which remains its official name in Canada and the United States.[5]

WWF is the world's largest conservation organization with over five million supporters worldwide, working in more than 100 countries, supporting around 3000 conservation and environmental projects.[6] They have invested over $1 billion in more than 12,000 conservation initiatives since 1995.[7] WWF is a foundation with 55% of funding from individuals and bequests, 19% from government sources (such as the World Bank, DFID, USAID) and 8% from corporations in 2014.[8][9]

WWF aims to "stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature."[10] The Living Planet Report has been published every two years by WWF since 1998; it is based on a Living Planet Index and ecological footprint calculation.[5] In addition, WWF has launched several notable worldwide campaigns including Earth Hour and Debt-for-Nature Swap, and its current work is organized around these six areas: food, climate, freshwater, wildlife, forests, and oceans.[5][7]

WWF has received criticism for its alleged corporate ties.[11][12] It has also been accused of supporting paramilitary groups tasked with stopping poaching who are responsible for numerous human rights abuses.[13][unreliable source?]
